          2004's Doom 3 and was a reboot of the franchise. It was released for
          PlayStation 4, Windows, and Xbox One in May 2016. A port for Nintendo
          Switch was co-developed with Panic Button and released in November
          2017, and a version for Google Stadia was released in August 2020.

          Doom was announced as Doom 4 in 2008, and that version underwent an
          extensive development cycle with different builds and designs before
          the game was restarted in 2011 and re-revealed as simply Doom in 2014.
          It was tested by customers who pre-ordered the 2014 MachineGames game
          Wolfenstein: The New Order and the general public. Mick Gordon
          composed the music, with contributions by Richard Devine. The game
          also has an online multiplayer component and a level editor known as
          "SnapMap", co-developed with Certain Affinity and Escalation Studios
          respectively.

          Doom was well received by critics and players. The single-player
          campaign, graphics, soundtrack, and gameplay received considerable
          praise, whereas the multiplayer mode drew significant criticism. It
          was the second best-selling video game in North America and the United
          Kingdom in the week of its release and sold over 500,000 copies for
          PCs by the end of May 2016. A sequel,
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_Eternal" target="_blank"
            >Doom Eternal</a
          >, was released in March 2020. A prequel,

            target="_blank"

      <h2 class="subtitle">gameplay</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Doom is a first-person shooter.Gameplay consists of fast movement and
          frenetic combat against aggressive and mobile opponents, as well as
          exploration of the game's environments via double-jumps and ledge
          climbing.To progress through the game, the player wields an arsenal of
          weapons influenced by those of the first Doom game and its sequel,
          Doom II, such as a chainsaw and BFG 9000, against undead and demonic
          opponents also influenced by the original Doom games. Weapons do not
          need to be reloaded and can be augmented with various mods obtained
          during the campaign.
        </p>
        <p>
          To replenish their resources, the player must pick up items or kill
          enemies. Players may recover health by using the "Glory Kill"
          mechanic, in which sufficiently damaged enemies enter a stunned state
          and may be killed by the player in a short melee animation. Ammunition
          can be replenished by using the chainsaw on an enemy, which instantly
          kills them if there is enough fuel in the chainsaw.

      <h2 class="subtitle last_subtitle">multiplayer</h2>
      <div class="text">
        <p>
          Doom supports an online multiplayer mode. Gamemodes include a basic
          Team Deathmatch and variations thereof called Freeze Tag, in which
          defeated players are frozen in ice and may be revived by teammates,
          and Soul Harvest, in which players must pick up "souls" dropped by
          slain opponents; Warpath, a variation of King of the Hill in which the
          hill moves around the map; Clan Arena, a team-based last man standing
          mode; and Domination, in which teams must capture and hold three
          locations. Players use a loadout consisting of two weapons chosen from
          an arsenal of weapons that may include weapons unique to the
          multiplayer mode. During matches, players may obtain "hack modules",
          one-use power-ups that convey information to the player, such as the
          time until other power-ups respawn. They may also obtain "runes" that
          temporarily transform them into demons. Playable demons include the
          Revenant, Baron of Hell, and Mancubus, also featured in the
          single-player campaign, and the Prowler and Harvester, which are not.
